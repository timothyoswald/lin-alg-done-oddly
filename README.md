This is a small side project of mine in which I'm compiling some Linear Algebra notes. The motivation behind this
is simply that I love the subject and wanted to create a nice set of notes containing everything I love about it. 
This is by no means a linear algebra textbook as I skip over many proof methods that I find to be simply computation
or extremely stale. However, I do think this will end up being a good resource for building intuition about how
linear algebra is constructed and the essence behind all the topics commonly taught in undergraduate courses about linear algebra.

I'll slowly update this as I find the time and learn more about linear algebra. If (when) you find any typos/mistakes, please reach out so I can fix it! (nxie88@gmail.com)
